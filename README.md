Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features, missing values, and relationships between variables.
Visualize key insights from the dataset using plots and graphs.
Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables as needed.

Machine Learning Models:

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for your predictive task (e.g., regression, classification).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance on the testing data.
Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or other relevant evaluation metrics.

Model Evaluation and Comparison:

Compare the performance of different machine learning models you experimented with.

Insights:

Use visualization techniques like feature importance plots to aid in interpretation.

Conclusion:

Summarize your findings from the project.
Reflect on the challenges faced and how you overcame them.
Suggest possible future improvements or extensions to the project.
